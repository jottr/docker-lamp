## Docker API

* How is it exposed on the system? 
** Which port? How can I access JSON-data apart from `docker inspect`? 

** Could I parse a container's JSON from PHP somehow? 

## PHP 

* Can I read local bash env into a php variable somehow?

## Docker env 

* Why is it, that I can display a linked containers env when I run
  /bin/bash interactively, and not when I run it as a daemon?  

# Autoenv

* Is it possible to run a script when cd-ing out of a directory? 
** Maybe there is an improved version of autoenv?
